ITC - 503 Video Presentation
1. Explain what pointers are in C++ programming and why they are important

2. Demonstrate how to declare a pointer variable and assign an address to it

int number = 20;
int* ptr = &number;

cout << "Address of number: " << &number << endl;
cout << "Value at ptr: " << *ptr << endl;

3. Explain the concept of array of pointers and highlight the advantages it offers over
multi-dimensional arrays by providing an example?

int* arr[3];
int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
arr[0] = &a;
arr[1] = &b;
arr[2] = &c;

4. Explain and demonstrate how pointers can be used for dynamic memory allocation,
specifically in relation to the assignment of creating a character array for storing the
human genome(Homework assignment 1) 
int* ptr = new int;
*ptr = 10;
delete ptr;


HumanGenome = new char[fileSize + 1];

delete[] HumanGenome;
